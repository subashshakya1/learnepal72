      <div class="content padBottom">
        <p><strong>Children's rights</strong>&nbsp;are the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children" title="Children">children</a>&nbsp;with particular attention to the rights of special protection  and care afforded to minors. Children's rights includes their right to  association with both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent" title="Parent">parents</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature" title="Human nature">human identity</a>&nbsp;as well as the basic needs for physical protection, food,  universal state-paid education, health care, and criminal laws appropriate for  the age and development of the child, equal protection of the child's&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>, and freedom from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a>&nbsp;on the basis of the child's&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification)" title="Race (human classification)">race</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation" title="Sexual orientation">sexual orientation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity" title="Gender identity">gender identity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_origin" title="National origin">national origin</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability" title="Disability">disability</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color" title="Human skin color">color</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a>, or other characteristics.  Interpretations of children's rights range from allowing children the capacity  for autonomous action to the enforcement of children being physically, mentally  and emotionally free from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse" title="Child abuse">abuse</a>, though what constitutes  &quot;abuse&quot; is a matter of debate. Other definitions include the rights  to care and nurturing.<br />
&quot;A child is any human being below the age of  eighteen years, unless under the law applicable to the child,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority" title="Age of majority">majority</a>&nbsp;is attained earlier.&quot; There are no definitions of other  terms used to describe young people such as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescent" title="Adolescent">adolescents</a>&quot;,  &quot;teenagers,&quot; or &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth" title="Youth">youth</a>&quot; in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a>, but the children's rights  movement is considered distinct from the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_rights" title="Youth rights">youth rights</a>&nbsp;movement. </p>
        <div>
          <p>Classification</p>
        </div>
        <p>Children have two types of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>&nbsp;under&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law" title="International human rights law">international  human rights law</a>. They have the same  fundamental general human rights as adults, although some human rights, such as  the&nbsp;right to marry, are dormant until they are of age, Secondly,  they have special human rights that are necessary to protect them during their  minority. General rights  operative in childhood include the&nbsp;rightto security of the  person,&nbsp;to freedom from  inhuman, cruel, or degrading treatment, and the&nbsp;rightto special protection during childhood. Particular human rights of children include,  among other rights, the&nbsp;right to life, the&nbsp;right to a name, the&nbsp;right to express his views in matters  concerning the child, the&nbsp;right to freedom of  thought, conscience and religion, the&nbsp;right to health care,  the&nbsp;right to protection  from economic and sexual exploitation, and the&nbsp;right to education. <br />
          Children's rights are defined in numerous  ways, including a wide spectrum of civil, cultural, economic, social and  political rights. Rights tend to be of two general types: those advocating for  children as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy" title="Autonomy">autonomous persons</a>&nbsp;under the law and those  placing a claim on society for protection from harms perpetrated on children  because of their dependency. These have been labeled as the&nbsp;<em>right of empowerment</em>&nbsp;and as the&nbsp;<em>right to protection</em>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_rights#cite_note-nesl.edu-16">[16]</a> <br />
          United Nations educational guides for  children classify the rights outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child" title="Convention on the Rights of the Child">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>&nbsp;as the &quot;3 Ps&quot;:  Provision, Protection, and Participation. They may be elaborated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Provision:</strong>&nbsp;Children have the right to  an adequate&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living" title="Standard of living">standard  of living</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care" title="Health care">health care</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a>&nbsp;and services, and to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)" title="Play (activity)">play</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation" title="Recreation">recreation</a>. These include a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_diet" title="Balanced diet">balanced diet</a>, a warm bed to sleep in,  and access to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. </li>
          <li><strong>Protection:</strong>&nbsp;Children have the right to  protection from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse" title="Child abuse">abuse</a>, neglect, exploitation and  discrimination. This includes the right to safe places for children to play;  constructive child rearing behavior, and acknowledgment of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolving_capacities" title="Evolving capacities">evolving  capacities</a>&nbsp;of children.</li>
          <li><strong>Participation:</strong>&nbsp;Children have the right to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_participation" title="Youth participation">participate  in communities</a>&nbsp;and have&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_program" title="Youth program">programs and services</a>&nbsp;for themselves. This  includes children's involvement in libraries and community programs,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_voice" title="Youth voice">youth voice</a>&nbsp;activities, and involving  children as decision-makers. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In a similar fashion, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Rights_Information_Network" title="Child Rights Information Network">Child Rights Information Network</a>, or CRIN for short,  categorizes rights into two groups: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Economic,  social and cultural rights, related to the conditions necessary to meet basic  human needs such as food, shelter, education, health care, and gainful  employment. Included are rights to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a>, adequate housing, food,  water, the highest attainable standard of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health" title="Health">health</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_work" title="Right to work">right to work</a>&nbsp;and rights at work, as well  as the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_rights" title="Cultural rights">cultural rights</a>&nbsp;of minorities and  indigenous peoples.</li>
          <li>Environmental,  cultural and developmental rights, which are sometimes called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_generation_rights" title="Third generation rights">third  generation rights</a>,&quot;  and including the right to live in safe and healthy environments and that  groups of people have the right to cultural, political, and economic  development.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty  International</a>&nbsp;openly advocates four particular children's  rights, including the end to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration" title="Incarceration">juvenile incarceration</a>&nbsp;without&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole" title="Parole">parole</a>, an end to the recruitment  of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children" title="Military use of children">military  use of children</a>,  ending the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>&nbsp;for people under 21, and  raising awareness of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_rights" title="Student rights">human rights in the classroom</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_rights#cite_note-Children.27s_Rights-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch" title="Human Rights Watch">Human  Rights Watch</a>,  an international advocacy organization, includes&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labor" title="Child labor">child labor</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_justice" title="Juvenile justice">juvenile justice</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan" title="Orphan">orphans</a>&nbsp;and abandoned children,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee" title="Refugee">refugees</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_children" title="Street children">street children</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_punishment" title="Corporal punishment">corporal  punishment</a>.<br />
          Scholarly study generally focuses children's  rights by identifying individual rights. The following rights &quot;allow  children to grow up healthy and free&quot;: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">Freedom of speech</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_thought" title="Freedom of thought">Freedom  of thought</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_from_fear" title="Freedom from fear">Freedom from fear</a></li>

          <li>Ownership  over one's body</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Difference between children's rights and youth rights</h3>
        <p>&quot;In the majority of jurisdictions, for  instance, children are not allowed to vote, to marry, to buy alcohol, to have  sex, or to engage in paid employment.&nbsp;Within the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_rights_movement" title="Youth rights movement">youth rights movement</a>, it is believed that the key  difference between&nbsp;children's&nbsp;rights and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_rights" title="Youth rights">youth</a>&nbsp;rights is that children's rights supporters generally  advocate the establishment and enforcement of protection for children and  youths, while youth rights (a far smaller movement) generally advocates the  expansion of freedom for children and/or youths and of rights such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">suffrage</a>.</p>
