        <h2>INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN RIGHT</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="content padBottom">
        <p><strong>Human rights</strong>&nbsp;are moral&nbsp;principles or&nbsp;norms,&nbsp;that describe certain standards of human  behavior, and are regularly protected as legal rights in&nbsp;municipal&nbsp;and&nbsp; international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable&nbsp;fundamental&nbsp;rights&nbsp;&quot;to which a person is inherently  entitled simply because she or he is a human being,&quot; and which are  &quot;inherent in all human beings&quot; regardless of their nation, location,  language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status.&nbsp;They are applicable everywhere and at  every time in the sense of being&nbsp;universal,&nbsp;and they are&nbsp;egalitarian&nbsp;in the sense of being the same for  everyone.&nbsp;They require empathy and the rule of law&nbsp;and impose an obligation on persons to  respect the human rights of others.&nbsp;They should not be taken away except as  a result of&nbsp;due process&nbsp;based on specific circumstances;&nbsp;for example, human rights may include  freedom from&nbsp;unlawful imprisonment,&nbsp;torture, and&nbsp;execution.</p>
        <h3>Right to life </h3>
        <p>Main  article:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life" title="Right to life">Right  to life</a><br />
          Every  human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by  law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.<br />
          — Article 6.1 of the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights <br />
          The  right to life is the essential right that a human being has the right not to be  killed by another human being. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept" title="Concept">concept</a>&nbsp;of a right to life is  central to debates on the issues of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense_(theory)" title="Self-defense (theory)">self defense</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_War" title="Just War">war</a>.  According to many human rights activists, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty" title="Death penalty">death  penalty</a>&nbsp;violates this right.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United  Nations</a>&nbsp;has called on states  retaining the death penalty to establish a moratorium on capital punishment  with a view to its abolition.&nbsp;States which do not do so  face considerable moral and political pressure.</p>
        <h3>Freedom from torture </h3>
        <p>Main  article:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture" title="Torture">Torture</a><br />
          Throughout  history, torture has been used as a method of political&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_control" title="Mind control">re-education</a>,  interrogation, punishment, and coercion. In addition to state-sponsored  torture, individuals or groups may be motivated to inflict torture on others  for similar reasons to those of a state; however, the motive for torture can  also be for the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism" title="Sadomasochism">sadistic</a>&nbsp;gratification of the  torturer, as in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors_murders" title="Moors murders">Moors  murders</a>.<br />
          Since  the mid-20th century, torture is prohibited under&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international  law</a>&nbsp;and the domestic laws of most countries. It is considered to be a  violation of human rights, and is declared to be unacceptable by Article 5 of  the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">UN</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human  Rights</a>. Signatories of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions of 1949</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_I" title="Protocol I">Additional  Protocols I</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_II" title="Protocol II">II</a>&nbsp;of June 8, 1977 officially  agree not to torture captured persons in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_conflicts" title="Armed conflicts">armed  conflicts</a>, whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited by  the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Torture" title="United Nations Convention Against Torture">United Nations Convention  Against Torture</a>, which has been ratified by 157 countries. <br />
          National  and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that  torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical.&nbsp;Despite these international  conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rehabilitation_Council_for_Torture_Victims" title="International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims">International  Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims</a>) report widespread use condoned  by states in many regions of the world.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#cite_note-79">[79]</a>&nbsp;Amnesty International  estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some  of them openly.</p>
